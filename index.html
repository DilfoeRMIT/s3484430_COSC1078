                <h2> Some information about me and my Interest in Information Technology. </h2>
                <p>
  My name is <strong>Dillon Foenander</strong>, I am currently undertaking an undergraduate course at <strong>RMIT University</strong> with my major being<strong> Business Information Systems (BP308) </strong>, and Specifically Introduction to Information Technology (COSC1078) as an Elective in my Final Year and have completed Many IT and Business Subjects Alike.
My Interest in Information Technology Started at a young age, when I started playing video and computer games. From Pokémon Gold on my first handheld device, Gameboy colour to Atlantis on my first Video Gaming Console, PlayStation one, It amazed me how worlds could be built into a device for you to explore endlessly, this of course led to a passion in all Things Technology; in General, could do, especially when code was involved. Turning words into actual computer processes such as the things that happened with applications as simple as paint and full three-dimensional worlds like croc and Spyro (3D action adventure games)  piqued my interest Which led me to take IT specific courses in Both High School and University; Information Technology Certificate ¾ as well as Interactive Digital Media Certificate ¾.
Within a workplace and in my everyday life; I have worked in the IT Sector as a Website Administrator as well as within the retail Industry selling IT Specific Products and Services.
I hope to use this later in life to pursue a career as a Business Analyst or any other job associated such, my learning and participation in work activities within the Sector I Hope to and Has thus far helped me acquire skills and knowledge Which are both empowering and Interesting at the same time.

            <p>
              The position I have chosen is that of a <strong> Full Stack Developer at JB Hi-Fi</strong>. A Full stack Developer must be a person who is both capable at Front end Web development, What the end user interacts with; This includes Coding Languages such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript. As well as proficient in Back end Web Development which is where the server-side coding takes place these include languages such as PHP, Python and C#.
              What makes this position appealing to me is the fact that I am proficient in Most if not all of the Programming Languages required to Successfully carry out the job , and the ones I am not, I am extremely enthusiastic to learn more on and develop my skills. There are also many positives for working for brand with such an avant-garde image other than exclusive discounts there is Job Security, A friendly team and Rewarding experiences.
              What is needed for me to Successfully acquire this role includes 5 or more years of experience in the Software development sector most likely dealing with Front and back end Web Development Codes and Tools. Luckily, I already have 5 years of experience with web development and have even worked previously as a website administrator for a small discount supermarket.
              Working within the retail industry and understanding how it works is another Piece of experience that has taught me to work well and learn around others, including customers.
              A bachelor’s degree in an Information Technology or Computer science may not be mandatory for the exact role I am applying for but will help me develop my skills as it is currently doing.
              Currently my Experience with web development goes as far as University work for Assignment, projects undertaken in my own time and Working for some time as a Web administrator Sending out Newsletters, maintaining a Bulletin and Catalogue on a website through Tools such as Dreamweaver and other Needed Languages to Build and Maintain a website with a CMS (Customer Management System)
              This taught me a great deal of skills and procedures for Web Development such as working within the Software Development Life Cycle, this contains six stages: analysis, design, development & testing, implementation, documentation, and evaluation. Which in turn makes me a perfect Candidate for this role in the Future.

            <p>
              My Plan Includes 3 Steps, <strong>Create a list of my Strengths and Weaknesses</strong> as I have defined earlier this is to highlight my positive attributes and work out contingencies for any weaknesses which I need to improve on, <strong>Proactively Seek out Workplaces that align with my own Goals</strong> by reading through what it is like to work at the company I am seeking out and making sure it aligns with my Current Life and Work Balance, Make sure I am<strong> Prepared and Present evidence</strong> so as to make it obvious I am ready to answer any questions or show examples of any previous work through a portfolio which I am currently gaining experience in from doing this and other HTML projects I have undertaken.

                    <h2>The following are an explanation of results for 3 Personality Tests I Undertook</h2>
                    <h3>What do the results of these tests mean to me?</h3>
                    <p>
                      The Results of the three Tests I did, gave me a broader understanding of my Personality and how I Learn and take in information. This is useful to me in making decisions about my work life and how I can organize myself and my time efficiently and effectively. I have been categorized by the <strong> Myers Briggs test as an Architect Personality type</strong>, this to me is fairly accurate as I am most of the time Introverted, and constantly am thinking of possible solutions to problems, This can help me choose jobs and groups more tailored to me.<strong> My learning style shows me that a visual learner </strong> may need certain aids to learn things, so reviewing info graphs and putting things into a visual context helps me understand problems/situations better. <strong> My enneagram further extends my curiosity into my personality type</strong>, Type six ‘the skeptic’ aligns with me being an ‘Architect’ Personality type.
                    </p>
                    <h3>How do i think these results may influence my behaviour in a team?</h3>
                    <p>
                      My results indicated that I am someone who tends to like to solve problems by themselves as a ‘lone wolf’ or in smaller groups with a succinct objective. That being said I believe in the IT work environment it is important to be able to work with others in a team, even as a web developer it is important to cross reference Goals and Objectives of the Entire business e.g. working with the Product Buyers of a Retail Company to align with the Products Displayed for the End-User on a Website. Hence, it will be somewhat difficult at times to work with a group, but problem solving and being a Team Leader to Reach a Common Objective is one of my Strengths which I can use to Bring a Team together and complete Goals.
                    </p>
                    <h3>How should I take this into account when forming a team?</h3>
                    <p>
                    Things I should consider when making a team is whether I will be working with people who will distract me from my Goal or the Groups Goals. I will most likely want to lead, the project as a whole if not my own area and have some control of the overall decisions made.
                  </p>
