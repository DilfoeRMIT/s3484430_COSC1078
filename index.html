 <h1>Hi, welcome to my Portfolio!</h1>

 <h1>A Short Biography</h1>
<p>
  My name is <strong>Dillon Foenander</strong>, I am currently undertaking an undergraduate course at RMIT University with my major being Business Information Systems, and Specifically Introduction to Information Technology (COSC1078) as an Elective in my Final Year and have completed Many IT and Business Subjects Alike.
My Interest in Information Technology Started at a young age, when I started playing video and computer games. From Pokémon Gold on my first handheld device, Gameboy colour to Atlantis on my first Video Gaming Console, PlayStation one, It amazed me how worlds could be built into a device for you to explore endlessly, this of course led to a passion in all Things Technology; in General, could do, especially when code was involved. Turning words into actual computer processes such as the things that happened with applications as simple as paint and full three-dimensional worlds like croc and Spyro (3D action adventure games)  piqued my interest Which led me to take IT specific courses in Both High School and University; Information Technology Certificate ¾ as well as Interactive Digital Media Certificate ¾.
Within a workplace and in my everyday life; I have worked in the IT Sector as a Website Administrator as well as within the retail Industry selling IT Specific Products and Services.
I hope to use this later in life to pursue a career as a Business Analyst or any other job associated such, my learning and participation in work activities within the Sector I Hope to and Has thus far helped me acquire skills and knowledge Which are both empowering and Interesting at the same time.

About me
<h1>The following are results of three tests which i undertook</h1>

<h2>What do the results of these tests mean for you?</h2>
<p>
  The Results of the three Tests I did, gave me a broader understanding of my Personality and how I Learn and take in information. This is useful to me in making decisions about my work life and how I can organize myself and my time efficiently and effectively.
I have been categorized by the Myers Briggs test as an Architect Personality type, this to me is fairly accurate as I am most of the time Introverted, and constantly am thinking of possible solutions to problems, This can help me choose jobs and groups more tailored to me
My learning style shows me that a visual learner may need certain aids to learn things, so reviewing info graphs and putting things into a visual context helps me understand problems/situations better.
My enneagram further extends my curiosity into my personality type, Type six ‘the skeptic’ aligns with me being an ‘Architect’ Personality type.
</p>

<h2> How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team? </h2>
<p>
  My results indicated that I am someone who tends to like to solve problems by themselves as a ‘lone wolf’ or in smaller groups with a succinct objective.
That being said I believe in the IT work environment it is important to be able to work with others in a team, even as a web developer it is important to cross reference Goals and Objectives of the Entire business e.g. working with the Product Buyers of a Retail Company to align with the Products Displayed for the End-User on a Website.
Hence, it will be somewhat difficult at times to work with a group, but problem solving and being a Team Leader to Reach a Common Objective is one of my Strengths which I can use to Bring a Team together and complete Goals.
</p>

<h2> How should you take this into account when forming a team? </h2>
<p>
  Things I should consider when making a team is whether I will be working with people who will distract me from my Goal or the Groups Goals. I will most likely want to lead, the project as a whole if not my own area and have some control.
